# Office-LTSC-2021-Installer

I got this from internet. for windows only.

**download** with command:

> setup.exe /download downloadconfig.xml

for change app language, edit downloadconfig.xml and replace:

> zh-cn

to other language.

**setup apps** before **install**:

> setup.exe /configure installconfig.xml

if language changed when you download files, you must edit installconfig.xml and replace:

> zh-cn

to other language.

## enjoy.
